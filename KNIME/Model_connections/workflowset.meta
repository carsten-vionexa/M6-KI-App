In order to run the workflow you need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one yet, register with OpenAI and create a new API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Please keep in mind that OpenAI will deprecate models on a regular basis. For more information about available models visit: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
